    "## Introduction\n",
    "- This Jupyter notebook addresses modeling and predicting the outcome of a NBA game  based on past game statistics. We use a data web scraper called BeautifulSoup, specifically used for Python, to scrape data from www.basketball-reference.com/, collecting game outcomes for each NBA team from the past 3 seasons. We put the data into various dataframes using the pandas library. This dataset was then cleaned and transformed to generate metrics whose averages serve as predictors in a Monte Carlo simulation using Poisson distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Monte Carlo simulations are widely used in sports betting, since the multitude of possibilities makes direct calculation of game outcomes impractical. Error correlation across games requires due care, as demonstrated with a realistic multilevel basketball model, similar to today's models. The model is built for the past seasons of 2016-2019, modeling how many points a certain team will score against another team, depending on which team is 'Away' and which team is 'Home'. This notebook focuses on clarifying the use of Monte Carlo simulations for probability calculations in sports."

    "## Background\n",
    "- Since the 1980s, the National Basketball Association (NBA) has cemented itself as a major player in the world of professional sports. With the growth of cable television, games are watched by millions of fans both domestically and internationally. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- With 30 teams each playing 82 games per season, professional basketball has become one of the most common avenues for sports gamblers to place bets. Professionals with years of experience and a strong understanding of the sport, generate gambling odds for each game, which can then be bet on through online gambling houses or casinos. Many die-hard basketball fans with good instincts have profited from betting against these odds. But how much does instinct really have to do with it?\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- There are some websites running simulation models to provide suggestions for people to bet. However, these websites are actually not free, like http://www.nbagamesim.com/. We would like to build our basic assumption - the scoring process follows Poisson distribution, and try to do the simulation ourselves.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- In this notebook, we will show that even with relatively little experience watching and analyzing basketball, statistical learning methods can be used to systematically predict the outcome of a NBA game. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- We found this topic very interesting and would like to build our own model to simulate the game results. History says that Possion distribution would be a good approximation to the dynamics of a sports game. Given the similar nature of sports game results, we think the Poisson process would be a good estimation for a basketball game as well. In this project, we will implement the model based on Poisson distribution and see how well the model could predict the actual result."

    "## Model Description\n",
    "- Data Collecting\n",
    "    - We use BeautifulSoup to collect historical NBA scores from www.basketball-reference.com/. The data includes the game data of the past 3 seasons (2016-2019).\n",
    "    - The function *get_data* works as a scraper to grab data from our source website. We apply this function on a specific year and month. We then merge the data altogether, and delete the useless data, to form a pandas dataframe, *stats*, that would be used in the next step. \n",
    "    - Information includes: the year and month of the played NBA game, home and away teams, and their scores.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Manipulation\n",
    "    - After we get the *stats* dataframe, we add the score difference and score sum of each game to the table.\n",
    "    - Then, we extract the list of NBA team names from the raw table, which will be used to construct the 'battle' format later.\n",
    "    - From the team name table, we then construct the 'battle' format dataframe called *games* for each possible NBA game, stating which team is the 'Away_Team' and the 'Home_Team'. This will be our core dataframe and it will be used to get simulation results.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulation Calculation\n",
    "    - In this stage, we created the 'Team' class to calculate some other detail parameters of each game, as well as other sample parameters that will be fed into the simulation later.\n",
    "    - The constructor initializes the parameters, including pinpointing relating data cells, average and variance of score sum, and variance of score difference.\n",
    "    - The *score_sum* method calculates the average sum of scores scored and conceded by each team. The *score_difference* method calculates the average (scored-conceded) per game for each team.\n",
    "    - Then, we calculate the parameters *delta_g* and *sigma_g* using the *score_difference* and *score_sum* methods respectively, and append the result to a data frame.\n",
    "    - Another class, 'Game', is created to facilitate the simulation process.\n",
    "    - As shown in the class constructor, it takes into two team names to initiate the simulation process. \n",
    "    - According to the model that has been specified in the following section, the *sim_result* method calculates the g parameters in the model.\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "- Simulation\n",
    "    - We use the *all_sim* function to run the simulation. *one_game* is an instance from the *Game* class, and we call the *sim_result* method to generate the simulation result.\n",
    "    - After the simulation, we wrote the result into a csv file, which has been sumitted in our project zip file.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Model accuracy test\n",
    "    - To have a better understanding regarding how our model works, we use the *test* function to compare the simulation result and the actual result.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- User interaction\n",
    "    - As described in the project purpose section, we want to provide a tool for basketball lovers to predict the game result of any game they choose. Hence, the last part of our project is designed for user interaction. Users can specify the teams of a certain match that they are interested in, and the model will print out a prediction result for the users."

    "## Model Development\n",
    "\n",
    "Conceptually, our analysis relies on recent observations in describing the teams: \n",
    "1. The home advantage is characterized by a team-independent but season-dependent increase of the home team score difference $c_{home} > 0$\n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "2. An appropriate observable to characterize the fitness of a team i in a given season is the average point difference (normalized per match) $\\Delta G_i(N)$, i.e. the difference of the points scored and conceded during N matches. In particular it contains more information about the team fitness than, e.g., the number of points.\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "So firstly, we would like to use our game data to compute $\\Delta G_i(N)$ and $\\sum G_i(N)$, which can be represented by the score difference and score sum.\n",
    "\n",
    "- As an immediate consequence, the limit of $\\Delta G_i(N)$ for large N, corresponding to the true fitness $\\Delta G_i$, is well-defined. Since we only have finite sample N games to compute $\\Delta G_i(N)$, the consistent estimator for $\\Delta G_i$, based on $\\Delta G_i(N)$, reads:\n",
    "\n",
    "    $$\\Delta G_i = a_N\\Delta G_i(N)$$\n",
    "\n",
    "    with $a_N = 1/[1+3/(N\\sigma^2_{\\Delta G})]$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Analogously, introducing $\\sum G_i(N)$ as the average sum of points scored and conceded by team i in N matches. \n",
    "    - The long-term limit can be estimated estimated via $\\Delta G_i - \\xi = b_N(\\sum G_i(N)-\\xi)$\n",
    "    with $b_N = 1/[1+3/(N\\sigma^2_{\\sum G})]$, where $\\xi$ is the average number of points per match in the respective season.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "Then, we would like to compute parameter $g_{i,j}$.\n",
    "$$ g_{i,j}=g_i-g_j$$\n",
    "\n",
    "$g_{i,j}$ express point difference of a match of team i vs. team j with the final result $g_i:g_j$. $g_i$ denotes our final simulation result for team i's score, $g_j$ denotes team j's score. Here we set team i to be the away team and team j to be the home team. \n",

    "\n",
    "- $q_{i,j}$ would need to fulfill the basic conditions (taking into account the home advantage):\n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- The most general and simple formula of estimate of $g_{i,j}$ (denoted by $\\widetilde g_{i,j}$) could be given as follow.\n",

There are research suggesting that the last-minute scores follow Power Law. It would be a possible modification to our current model.\n",
